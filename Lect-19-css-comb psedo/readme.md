# CSS Important Concepts (Detailed Guide)

This README covers important CSS concepts with examples and references.

---

## 1. Difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`

### ðŸ”¹ `display: none`
- The element is **completely removed** from the layout.
- It doesnâ€™t take any space on the page.

```css
div {
  display: none;
}
````

ðŸ‘‰ Example: If you hide a `<div>` using `display: none`, other elements will shift as if it doesnâ€™t exist.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `visibility: hidden`

* The element **is still in the layout** but becomes invisible.
* It occupies space but canâ€™t be seen.

```css
div {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Example: If you hide a `<div>` using `visibility: hidden`, other elements will stay in their positions, leaving empty space.

## 2. CSS Combinators

Combinators define the relationship between two selectors.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Combinators:

1. **Descendant selector (space)**
   Selects all elements inside another element.

   ```css
   div p {
     color: red;
   }
   ```

   ðŸ‘‰ All `<p>` inside `<div>` will turn red.

---

2. **Child selector (`>`)**
   Selects direct children only.

   ```css
   div > p {
     color: blue;
   }
   ```

---

3. **Adjacent sibling selector (`+`)**
   Selects the element immediately after another.

   ```css
   h1 + p {
     color: green;
   }
   ```

---

4. **General sibling selector (`~`)**
   Selects all siblings after an element.

   ```css
   h1 ~ p {
     color: purple;
   }
   ```

## 3. CSS Pseudo-Classes

Pseudo-classes define the **state** of an element.

### ðŸ”¹ Examples:

```css
/* Change color when hovered */
button:hover {
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* Change link color when visited */
a:visited {
  color: purple;
}

/* First child */
p:first-child {
  color: blue;
}
```

## 4. Icons and Emojis in VS Code

### ðŸ”¹ Icons

* VS Code shows icons using **extensions** like:

  * [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
  * [VSCode Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)

They help to identify files (HTML, CSS, JS, React, etc.) with unique icons.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Emojis

* Emojis are **Unicode characters**.
* You can type them anywhere in your code/comments using:

  * **Windows**: `Win + .` (dot)
  * **Mac**: `Control + Command + Space`

ðŸ‘‰ Example in HTML:

```html
<p>Welcome ðŸ˜€ ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰</p>
```

## âœ… Summary

* **`display: none` vs `visibility: hidden`** â†’ space behavior difference.
* **CSS Combinators** â†’ relationships between selectors (` `, `>`, `+`, `~`).
* **Pseudo-classes** â†’ element states like `:hover`, `:focus`, `:first-child`.
* **Icons/Emojis** â†’ come from VS Code extensions or Unicode input.
